I threw this together in a couple of hours for a Stack Exchange answer. It takes a given set of coordinates in the sky and then recalculates the position of [120,000 nearby stars](http://www.astronexus.com/hyg) as seen from this location.

Right now, it uses the Hipparcos, Yale Bright Star and Gliese databases, though that could change. The relevant CSV file is about 27 MB, which I can't easily upload to GitHub, so I invite anyone curious enough to download the catalog and play around themselves.
